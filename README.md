# mkts

mkts (make typescript) is a tool that takes you from an empty folder to a running Typescript
application base in literal seconds. **mkts** generates super straightforward, ready-to-go
application bases, you can start working with right away. It preconfigures your new project with
many tools that you'd otherwise have to setup yourself, saving you all the hassle.
